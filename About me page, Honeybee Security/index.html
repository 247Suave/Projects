                <h5>Honeybee Security</h5>
                <p>
                    In 2003, Suave de Honeybee arrived in london from Italy with his heart set on improving the use of the internet. With his revolutionary understanding of computers and the underlining software involved, Honeybee flourished under the direction of the charismatic chief. Since 2008, the Honeybe family have owned the company and enrolled over 40 stores in the UK with over 500 employees. Honeybee is now more than just a cybersecurity site or store, its a whole expierence. All thanks Suave.
